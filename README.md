# IdeaSpark - Ignite Your Creativity

IdeaSpark is a platform to brainstorm, share, and discover innovative concepts. It's built with a modern tech stack and leverages AI to enhance the user experience. This project was developed iteratively in Firebase Studio.

## Tech Stack

*   **Frontend**: Next.js (App Router with Server Components by default), React, TypeScript
*   **UI**: ShadCN UI Components, Tailwind CSS
*   **Generative AI**: Genkit (with Google AI - Gemini models)
*   **State Management**:
    *   React Context (for mock authentication)
    *   `localStorage` (for storing ideas, upvotes, and saved idea lists)
*   **Styling**: Tailwind CSS, global CSS for theming (light/dark mode) and animations.

## Key Features

*   **Mock User Authentication**: Simple login/signup functionality to simulate user sessions.
*   **Idea Submission**: Users can submit new ideas with a title, detailed description, category, and tags.
    *   **AI-Powered Tag Suggestions**: While submitting an idea, users receive AI-generated tag suggestions based on the idea's description.
*   **Idea Feed**:
    *   Browse a dynamic feed of all submitted and mock ideas.
    *   Ideas are displayed in cards with cover images, user details, upvotes, and tags.
    *   **Search & Filter**: Filter ideas by search term (title, description, tags), category, and sort by recency or popularity.
*   **Idea Detail Page**: View the full details of an individual idea, including its description, author, and tags.
*   **Upvote Ideas**: Users can upvote ideas they find interesting. Upvote counts are persisted.
*   **Save/Unsave Ideas**: Users can bookmark ideas they want to revisit.
    *   **Saved Ideas Page**: A dedicated page (`/saved-ideas`) lists all ideas saved by the logged-in user.
*   **AI Chatbot for Ideas**: Users can open a chat modal for any idea to ask questions and get AI-generated answers about it.
*   **Dynamic AI-Generated Hero Image**: The hero image on the homepage is dynamically generated by an AI model on page load.
*   **Colorful Placeholder Images**: Mock ideas and newly submitted ideas feature colorful placeholder images for visual appeal.
*   **Responsive Design**: The application is designed to work well on various screen sizes.
*   **Theming**: Supports light and dark mode, with a modern animated background.
*   **Toast Notifications**: For user feedback on actions like saving/unsaving ideas or form submissions.

## Getting Started

To get this project running locally:

1.  **Clone the repository** (if applicable).
2.  **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Environment Variables**:
    *   This project uses Genkit for AI features, which typically requires API keys for the AI models (e.g., Google AI). Ensure your `.env` file is configured with necessary API keys if you're running Genkit flows that call external services. For example:
        ```
        GOOGLE_API_KEY=YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY_HERE
        ```
4.  **Run the Next.js development server**:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    This usually starts the app on `http://localhost:9002`.

5.  **Run the Genkit development server** (in a separate terminal):
    ```bash
    npm run genkit:dev
    ```
    This starts the Genkit development environment, allowing your Next.js app to call the defined AI flows.

## Project Structure Overview

*   `src/app/`: Contains the Next.js pages and layouts using the App Router.
    *   `page.tsx`: Homepage.
    *   `ideas/[id]/page.tsx`: Idea detail page.
    *   `submit-idea/page.tsx`: Page for submitting new ideas.
    *   `saved-ideas/page.tsx`: Page to view saved ideas.
    *   `login/page.tsx`, `signup/page.tsx`: Mock authentication pages.
    *   `globals.css`: Global styles and Tailwind CSS theme configuration.
    *   `layout.tsx`: Root layout for the application.
*   `src/components/`: Contains reusable React components.
    *   `auth/`: Authentication related components (login/signup forms).
    *   `core/`: Core UI elements like loading spinners.
    *   `ideas/`: Components related to ideas (feed, card, form, filters, chatbot modal, tag input).
    *   `layout/`: Layout components (Navbar, Footer, Logo, MainLayout, animated background).
    *   `ui/`: ShadCN UI components.
*   `src/ai/`: Genkit related files.
    *   `genkit.ts`: Genkit global instance configuration.
    *   `dev.ts`: Entry point for Genkit development server, imports all flows.
    *   `flows/`: Contains all Genkit flow definitions (e.g., `idea-chatbot.ts`, `suggest-tags.ts`, `generate-hero-image-flow.ts`).
*   `src/lib/`: Contains utility functions, type definitions, mock data, and server actions.
    *   `actions.ts`: Next.js server actions (e.g., for form submissions, calling AI flows).
    *   `mockData.ts`: Initial set of mock ideas for the feed.
    *   `types.ts`: TypeScript type definitions for the application.
    *   `utils.ts`: Utility functions (e.g., `cn` for classnames).
*   `src/contexts/`: React context providers (e.g., `AuthContext.tsx`).
*   `src/hooks/`: Custom React hooks (e.g., `useAuth.ts`, `useToast.ts`).
*   `public/`: Static assets (though currently not heavily used for images, which are mostly placeholders or data URIs).

This updated README should give a much clearer picture of what IdeaSpark is and how it's built!
